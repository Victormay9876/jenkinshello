Lululemon

At Lululemon, I’ve been involved in 
designing and maintaining scalable,
 secure, and cost-effective cloud 
infrastructure as a Cloud DevOps Engineer.
 My role focuses on automating 
deployments, optimizing cloud security,
 and streamlining CI/CD pipelines.
I’ve worked with AWS services 
like EKS, Lambda, and CloudFormation,
 using Terraform to manage infrastructure
 as code. I’ve involved in running 
security scans, enforcing IAM policies 
to ensure proper access controls,
 managing secrets rotation to keep 
credentials secure, and continuously
 monitoring AWS accounts to maintain
 complianc. I’ve been optimizing cloud
 costs by automating processes with 
Lambda functions and CloudWatch Event
 Rules, helping to reduce unnecessary 
spending and improve efficiency.
Other than that, I manage Amazon
 EKS clusters—handling upgrades,
 securing access, and automating 
deployments. I’ve implemented
 solutions like injecting secrets
 into applications using AWS Secrets
 Manager and developing monitoring 
alerts for EKS events. 
I have standardized application
 deployment configurations across
 multiple environments, reducing 
complexity and improving efficiency.
I’ve documented processes,
 recorded implementations,
 and provided deployment support,
 ensuring smooth operations
 in production.
